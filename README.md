# work-files
All of my VBA modules
Starting 7/10/19 I will be uploading all the code in my vba modules here. I still have to figure out the best way to export/import the files from the spreadsheet.

7/29/19 - Using a way to import files found online (documented in code). This pulls the files out of excel, then I move them to the github folder and commit.
